Note that the workshop will be **in-person only** to facilitate in-depth discussion among all participants, and to avoid challenges in ensuring equitable opportunities for participation between in-person and remote attendees. While we acknowledge that this decision would unfortunately exclude those who cannot travel to attend in person, we believe that this trade-off would result in a superior experience for those who do attend, and is better aligned with the primary community-building aim of the workshop. Alongside synchronous in-person engagement, we will use [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/WtEzx43ZmD), which anyone is free to join, for asynchronous discussions before, during, and after the workshop.
