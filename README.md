# CHI 2025 T4T Workshop

This repository contains the website for the CHI 2025 Workshop on Tools for Thought.

It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

To make changes to the website, you can edit the markdown file `index.md` in the root directory. This file contains the content for the homepage of the website. Other pages to edit include the layout file `/_layouts/default.html` and the stylesheet `/assets/css/style.css`.
