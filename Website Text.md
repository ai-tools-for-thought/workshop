## Abstract

We invite researchers, designers, practitioners, and provocateurs to explore what it means to understand and shape the impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on human cognition. GenAI radically widens the scope and capability of automation for work, learning, and creativity. While impactful, it also changes workflows and the quality of thinking involved, raising questions about its effects on cognition, including critical thinking and learning. 

Yet, GenAI also offers opportunities for designing tools for thought that protect and augment cognition. Such systems provoke critical thinking, provide personalized tutoring, or enable novel ways of sensemaking, among other approaches. How does GenAI change workflows and human cognition? What are opportunities and challenges for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human cognition? Which theories, perspectives, and methods are relevant? 

This workshop aims to develop a multidisciplinary community interested in exploring these questions to protect against the erosion, and fuel the augmentation, of human cognition using GenAI.

## Workshop Aims [Roll into CfP]

With GenAI's rapid real-world adoption and the proliferation of GenAI-driven systems, now is the time to initiate a dedicated effort in understanding what this means for human cognition, and how we can shape this technology for our wide-ranging benefit. The CHI community has both the duty and the means to explore this. This effort requires multi-disciplinary collaboration. CHI is a unique venue that brings together not only HCI technical system designers, developers, and engineers, but also those from psychology, linguistics, anthropology, sociology, learning science, communications, management, science studies, history, and policy, among others. Similar efforts have arisen in the past, with areas such as Explainable AI and Responsible AI developing strong communities of interest and numerous resources.

Cognitive concepts have been alluded to in these contexts, but have not been their core focus—in contrast, our effort is distinctly concerned with the impacts of GenAI on human cognition and the implications for the way people learn, build skills, and grow expertise. Thus, this workshop has two aims: 

As the initial instance of an anticipated series, we want to identify and coalesce a multidisciplinary community interested in understanding and shaping the impact of GenAI on human cognition. We want to map the space of opportunities in this area, in terms of the following high-level questions:

- How do GenAI systems change workflows? What activities become more or less important? What activities are eliminated and created?
- What is the impact of current GenAI paradigms on human cognition, such as our ability to learn, think critically and creatively, reason, remember, and do sensemaking in contexts from creative art to programming or scientific research? How can we better understand and mitigate potential negative impacts, and maximize positive impacts? • What does it mean to protect and augment human cognition?
- What are opportunities and challenges for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human cognition? How do we develop principles or guidelines for doing so?
- Which contemporary and historical theories and perspectives—from across disciplines—are relevant for understanding the impact of GenAI on cognition and workflows, and for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human cognition?
- How do we study the impact of current GenAI paradigms and novel GenAI systems for protecting and augmenting human cognition?
  
Given the breadth and complexity of these questions, we do not expect this initial workshop to provide definitive answers to the above, but rather to initiate focused conversations that lay the groundwork for addressing these questions as a community.

An underlying aim of this workshop and its community is to strengthen the link between understanding the impact of GenAI on cognition and designing new systems that protect and augment cognition. For example, exploring foundational theories and approaches to studying impact from across relevant disciplines is not only useful for its own sake, but will provide principled grounds for designing novel GenAI systems and evaluating their afforded experiences and effectiveness. The connection between descriptive theories and prescriptive design is illustrated in recent studies on AI-enabled tutoring systems, which examine the impact of current GenAI systems on learning, harness pedagogical principles to inform the design of new systems, and conduct comparative evaluations. There are similar opportunities for designing GenAI systems that support critical thinking or sensemaking in knowledge work. CHI's multidisciplinary community, its focus on contextual understanding of technologies, and its strength in designing real-world systems, therefore make it the ideal venue for this workshop.

**Elena Glassman** is an Assistant Professor at Harvard University's Paulson School Of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Her research focuses on building AI-resilient interfaces that support meta-cognition through a variety of novel interface features and affordances that enhance user's reading, writing, and sensemaking abilities. These features include constructive antagonism and reifying (1) multiple recursive levels of detail, (2) natural language commands as dynamically generated UI widgets, and (3) pre-computed similarities and distinctions across many items in a corpus at both the literal and analogical levels, e.g., OverCode, Examplore, ParaLib, and Positional Diction Clustering. Her group specializes in leveraging theories of human cognition about how humans form mental models from varying concrete examples.

**Aniket Kittur** is a Professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute in Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science. His research explores combining human and machine intelligence to scale up sensemaking and innovation in domains including scientific literature, decision making, productivity, and analogical design.

**Mina Lee** is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science, Data Science Institute, and Cognitive Science (affiliated) at the University of Chicago. Her research centers around Writing with AI, especially how AI is transforming our writing process, the content we produce, and our identities as writers. She was named one of MIT Technology Review's Korean Innovators under 35 in 2022. She has co-founded and organized workshops on Intelligent and Interactive Writing Assistants (In2Writing) and Human-centered Evaluation and Auditing of Language Models (HEAL) at ACL 2022, CHI 2023, and CHI 2024.

**Srishti Palani** is a Senior Researcher at Tableau Research. She researches at the intersection of Cognitive Science, Human-Centered AI and Human-Computer Interaction. Her research investigates how people think and behave while exploring, sensemaking and being creative and with Generative AI and information on the Web. Based on this understanding of user behaviors and cognition, she builds interactive intelligent systems that augment these human cognitive abilities. She earned her doctorate and master's from the University of California, San Diego.

**Majeed Kazemitabaar** is a PhD candidate at University of Toronto, where he is researching on and developing tools that balance productivity and cognitive engagement in AI-assisted programming. He has studied the impact of learning to code with AI on subsequent performance without AI, to measure the effects of overreliance on AI. He has developed and evaluated programming tools based on the concept of "Friction-Induced AI" to achieve two goals: enhancing short-term productivity by improving verification through added intervention points, and preventing long-term productivity loss by requiring user engagement with AI-generated code.

**Jessica He** is a UX Designer at IBM Research, where she is a member of the Human-AI Collaboration team. Her work focuses on leveraging design to bridge the gap between user expectations and emerging AI technologies, encompassing topics including AI attribution, risk mitigation, and enhancing knowledge work.
