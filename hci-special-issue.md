<h1>HCI Special Issue on Generative AI in Tools for Thought: Theory, Design, and Assessment
<br></h1>

## Call for Articles

We are pleased to announce a call for articles for an upcoming special issue of the HCI Journal, titled "Generative AI in Tools for Thought: Theory, Design, & Assessment.".

## Why This Issue Matters
Generative AI is rapidly reshaping cognitive workflows—from creative writing to scientific reasoning. Yet we still grapple with questions: Does GenAI amplify our creativity or foster over-reliance? How do we design AI systems that preserve critical thinking and cognitive agency? This special issue brings together HCI scholars, cognitive scientists, designers, and ethicists to tackle these challenges.

## What We’re Looking For
- **Understanding Cognitive Impacts:** Empirical or ethnographic studies on creativity, problem solving, learning curves, and dependency.
- **Theoretical Frameworks:** Extensions or new models addressing human–AI sensemaking and distributed cognition.
- **Design Principles & Practices:** Case studies of AI-driven tools that scaffold reflection and protect cognitive skills.
- **Evaluation Methods:** Innovative approaches combining behavioral metrics with longitudinal assessments and neurophysiological data.
- **Ethical & Societal Implications:** Analyses of autonomy, equity in access, cross-cultural contexts, and industry-academic commentaries.

## Exemplar Questions
- How can we measure cognitive transfer from AI-assisted to unassisted tasks?
- What design frameworks ensure GenAI remains a true cognitive partner?
- How do different GenAI interfaces affect decision-making and autonomy?

## Key Dates
- Proposals Due: October 15, 2025
- Proposal Decisions: October 30, 2025
- Full Paper Deadline: January 28, 2026
- First Reviews to Authors: April 2, 2026
- Revised Papers Due: May 13, 2026
- Final Decisions: June 26, 2026
- Camera-Ready Papers Due: July 22, 2026
- Publication: ~September, 2026

## How to submit article proposals.
Successful articles submission will have to first submit an article proposal of 500 words (maximum) including title, authors and abstract. Proposals should also include a 50-word bio of the authors.

We will be accepting two kinds of submissions: traditional articles that present novel systems, research and ideas, as well as commentary articles. Commentary articles are submissions where a core or seminal paper is commented on by others. Commentaries are appropriate for articulating diverse viewpoints and for including perspectives beyond the papers included. Potential commentary topics include: "The Cognitive Dependency Debate: Enhancement vs. Atrophy"; "Industry vs. Academic Perspectives on GenAI Cognitive Tools"; and "Cross-Cultural Views on Cognitive Augmentation"

Article proposals can be in .docx or .pdf format and need to be submitted using the following [online form](https://forms.gle/2WZurcr4A46Whh7E8) **until October 15th, 2025 (anywhere on earth)**.

## Looking forward to your contributions!
Feel free to share this announcement with colleagues and research networks. We look forward to your contributions in shaping tools that empower human thought.

Warm regards, and stay tunned for more details.
