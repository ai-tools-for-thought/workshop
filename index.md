## About {#about}

We invite researchers, designers, practitioners, and provocateurs to explore what it means to understand and shape the impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on human cognition. GenAI radically widens the scope and capability of automation for work, learning, and creativity. While impactful, it also changes workflows and the quality of thinking involved, raising questions about its effects on cognition, including critical thinking and learning. Yet, GenAI also offers opportunities for designing “tools for thought” that protect and augment cognition. Such systems provoke critical thinking, provide personalized tutoring, or enable novel ways of sensemaking, among other approaches.  

 

How does GenAI change workflows and human cognition? What are opportunities and challenges for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human cognitionthinking? Which theories, perspectives, and methods are relevant? This workshop aims to develop a multidisciplinary community interested in exploring these questions to protect against the erosion, and fuel the augmentation, of human cognition using GenAI. 

## Submission Process {#submission}

Workshop participants should submit pieces that highlight interesting points of discussion, opinions, open research questions, descriptions of user experiences and ongoing or planned research, around opportunities and challenges for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human cognition.  All submissions require a paper that is 2-4 pages in length, formatted according to the SIGCHI template (\documentclass[sigconf,screen]{acmart}). We also encourage links to videos, visual or computational portfolios, prototypes etc.

Topics of interest for the position papers include (but are not limited to):

- Impact of Generative AI paradigms on human thinking and workflows – what needs to be maintained without AI, what can be offloaded to AI, and what would be best augmented by AI? 
- What contemporary and historical theories and perspectives are relevant to understanding, protecting, and augmenting human thinking? 
- What are the opportunities and challenges for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human thinking? 
- How do we study and measure the impact of current and novel GenAI systems for protecting and augmenting human thinking? 
- What are the principles or guidelines for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human thinking? 


Upload your position paper to [FORM TO BE CREATED] 

 

All submissions will be reviewed based on relevance to the workshop theme of "Understanding, Protecting, and Augmenting Human Cognition with Generative AI" as well as quality and diversity. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop. 

 

The list of accepted papers will be posted on the website and will be available for download prior to the workshop.

## Workshop Aims {#aims}

With GenAI's rapid real-world adoption and the proliferation of GenAI-driven systems, now is the time to initiate a dedicated effort in understanding what this means for human cognition, and how we can shape this technology for our wide-ranging benefit. The CHI community has both the duty and the means to explore this. This effort requires multi-disciplinary collaboration. CHI is a unique venue that brings together not only HCI technical system designers, developers, and engineers, but also those from psychology, linguistics, anthropology, sociology, learning science, communications, management, science studies, history, and policy, among others. Similar efforts have arisen in the past, with areas such as Explainable AI and Responsible AI developing strong communities of interest and numerous resources. 

 

Cognitive concepts have been alluded to in these contexts, but have not been their core focus—in contrast, our effort is distinctly concerned with the impacts of GenAI on human cognition and the implications for the way people learn, build skills, and grow expertise. Thus, this workshop has two aims:  

 

As the initial instance of an anticipated series, we want to identify and coalesce a multidisciplinary community interested in understanding and shaping the impact of GenAI on human cognition. We want to map the space of opportunities in this area, in terms of the following high-level questions: 

 

- How do GenAI systems change workflows? What activities become more or less important? What activities are eliminated and created? 

- What is the impact of current GenAI paradigms on human cognition, such as our ability to learn, think critically and creatively, reason, remember, and do sensemaking in contexts from creative art to programming or scientific research? How can we better understand and mitigate potential negative impacts, and maximize positive impacts? 

- What does it mean to protect and augment human cognition? 

- What are opportunities and challenges for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human cognition? How do we develop principles or guidelines for doing so? 

- Which contemporary and historical theories and perspectives—from across disciplines—are relevant for understanding the impact of GenAI on cognition and workflows, and for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human cognition? 

- How do we study the impact of current GenAI paradigms and novel GenAI systems for protecting and augmenting human cognition? 

   

Given the breadth and complexity of these questions, we do not expect this initial workshop to provide definitive answers to the above, but rather to initiate focused conversations that lay the groundwork for addressing these questions as a community. 

 

An underlying aim of this workshop and its community is to strengthen the link between understanding the impact of GenAI on cognition and designing new systems that protect and augment cognition. For example, exploring foundational theories and approaches to studying impact from across relevant disciplines is not only useful for its own sake, but will provide principled grounds for designing novel GenAI systems and evaluating their afforded experiences and effectiveness. The connection between descriptive theories and prescriptive design is illustrated in recent studies on AI-enabled tutoring systems, which examine the impact of current GenAI systems on learning, harness pedagogical principles to inform the design of new systems, and conduct comparative evaluations. There are similar opportunities for designing GenAI systems that support critical thinking or sensemaking in knowledge work. CHI's multidisciplinary community, its focus on contextual understanding of technologies, and its strength in designing real-world systems, therefore make it the ideal venue for this workshop.
