# CHI 2025 Workshop on Tools for Thought {#home}

__Research and Design for Understanding, Protecting, and Augmenting Human Cognition with Generative AI__

## About the Workshop {#about}

Generative AI (GenAI) radically widens the scope and capability of automation for work, learning, and creativity. While impactful, it also changes workflows and the quality of thinking involved, raising questions about its effects on cognition, including critical thinking and learning.
Yet, GenAI also offers opportunities for designing tools for thought that protect and augment cognition. Such systems provoke critical thinking, provide personalized tutoring, or enable novel ways of sensemaking, among other approaches.

The CHI community has both the duty and the means to explore this. This effort requires multi-disciplinary collaboration. CHI is a unique venue that brings together not only HCI technical system designers, developers, and engineers, but also those from psychology, linguistics, anthropology, sociology, learning science, communications, management, science studies, history, and policy, among others. We are particularly concerned with the impacts of GenAI on human cognition and the implications for the way people learn, build skills, and grow expertise.

This workshop aims to develop a multidisciplinary community interested in exploring these questions to protect against the erosion, and fuel the augmentation, of human cognition using GenAI. We thus invite researchers, designers, practitioners, and provocateurs to explore what it means to understand and shape the impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on human cognition.

## Call for Participation {#call}

We are pleased to invite position papers for the half-day workshop on "Tools for Thought: Research and Design for Understanding, Protecting, and Augmenting Human Cognition with Generative AI" at CHI 2025.
The workshop is intended for researchers and practitioners from industry or academia working in Human-Computer Interaction, Arts, Ethics, Social Sciences, Design, Psychology, or anyone working on topics related to human cognition and AI.
Workshop participants are encouraged to submit position papers that highlight interesting points of discussion, opinions, open research questions, and ongoing or planned research. We accept position papers between 2-4 pages in length, formatted according to the SIGCHI template (\documentclass[sigconf,screen]{acmart}).

**As the initial instance of an anticipated series**, we want to identify and coalesce a multidisciplinary community interested in understanding and shaping the impact of GenAI on human cognition. We want to map the space of opportunities in this area, in terms of the following high-level questions:

- How do GenAI systems change workflows? What activities become more or less important? What activities are eliminated and created?
- What is the impact of current GenAI paradigms on human cognition, such as our ability to learn, think critically and creatively, reason, remember, and do sensemaking in contexts from creative art to programming or scientific research? How can we better understand and mitigate potential negative impacts, and maximize positive impacts?
- What does it mean to protect and augment human cognition?
- What are opportunities and challenges for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human cognition? How do we develop principles or guidelines for doing so?
- Which contemporary and historical theories and perspectives—from across disciplines—are relevant for understanding the impact of GenAI on cognition and workflows, and for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human cognition?
- How do we study the impact of current GenAI paradigms and novel GenAI systems for protecting and augmenting human cognition?
  
Given the breadth and complexity of these questions, we do not expect this initial workshop to provide definitive answers to the above, but rather to initiate focused conversations that lay the groundwork for addressing these questions as a community.

### Submission Process {#submission}

1. Submission material should be sent to <lev.tankelevitch@microsoft.com>
2. Please also submit a personal statement of up to 600 words describing your relevant background, motivation for attending, and specific areas of interest. This will be considered holistically with the submitted work. [Link to form]

All submissions will be reviewed based on relevance to the conference theme - "Understanding, Protecting, and Augmenting Human Cognition with Generative AI" as well as quality and diversity. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop.

The list of accepted papers will be posted on the website and will be available for download prior to the workshop.
