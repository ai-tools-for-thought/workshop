## About {#about}

We invite researchers, designers, practitioners, and provocateurs to explore what it means to understand and shape the impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on human cognition. GenAI radically widens the scope and capability of automation for work, learning, and creativity. While impactful, it also changes workflows, raising questions about its effects on cognition, including critical thinking and learning. Yet GenAI also offers opportunities for designing “tools for thought” that protect and augment cognition. Such systems provoke critical thinking, provide personalized tutoring, or enable novel ways of sensemaking, among other approaches.  

How does GenAI change workflows and human cognition? What are opportunities and challenges for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment thinking? Which theories, perspectives, and methods are relevant? This workshop aims to develop a multidisciplinary community interested in exploring these questions to protect against the erosion, and fuel the augmentation, of human cognition using GenAI.

## Submission Process {#submission}

All submissions require EITHER a **paper** that is 2-4 pages in length [formatted according to the ACM article template with ‘sigconf’ style (\documentclass[sigconf,screen]{acmart}) ([LaTeX template instructions](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-latex)), or ACM primary article template if using Microsoft Word ([Word template instructions](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word))]; OR a **portfolio of work (accompanied by description of relevance)**. In either case, we encourage links to videos, visual or computational portfolios, prototypes etc.

Please submit work that highlights interesting points of discussion, opinions, open research questions, descriptions of user experiences and ongoing or planned research, around opportunities and challenges for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human cognition.

Topics of interest for the position papers include (but are not limited to):

- What contemporary and historical theories and perspectives are relevant to understanding, protecting, and augmenting human thinking?
- What are the opportunities and challenges for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human thinking?
- How do we study and measure the impact of current and novel GenAI systems for protecting and augmenting human thinking?
- What will the impact of Generative AI paradigms be on human skills and the workflows of which they are a part – what skills needs to be maintained without AI, what skills can be offloaded to AI, and what skills would be best augmented by AI?
- What are the principles or guidelines for designing GenAI systems that protect and augment human thinking?

#### Please submit your application via this <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/CahyHpHDEB" target="_blank">submission form</a>. 

Submissions should include the following information:

- Corresponding author name
- Corresponding author email
- Corresponding author institution
- Short personal statement from each attending author on a submission. The statement should focus on relevant background, motivations, and interests for the workshop (max 150 words per statement).
- Submission title
- Submission keywords
- Submission URL (**ensure we have read-access**) 
- URL to other supporting files, if applicable (e.g., videos, prototypes, visual or computational portfolios)

Workshop participants will be selected through a review process. Submissions will be reviewed by at least two members of the workshop’s organizing committee ([ACM category: Reviewed](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/pre-publication-evaluation)). Submissions will be reviewed based on relevance to the workshop theme of "Understanding, Protecting, and Augmenting Human Cognition with Generative AI" as well as quality and diversity. 

A subset of submissions will be selected for a lightning talk and panel discussion.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for and attend the workshop. Note that, unlike in previous years, if you are **only** attending a workshop, there is no need to additionally register for the CHI conference. Registration for the conference is required if you are attending any other sessions.

The list of accepted papers will be posted on the website: https://ai-tools-for-thought.github.io/workshop/  and will be available for download prior to the workshop.

Note that the workshop will be **in-person only** to facilitate in-depth discussion among all participants, and to avoid challenges in ensuring equitable opportunities for participation between in-person and remote attendees. While we acknowledge that this decision would unfortunately exclude those who cannot travel to attend in person, we believe that this trade-off would result in a superior experience for those who do attend, and is better aligned with the primary community-building aim of the workshop. Alongside synchronous in-person engagement, we will use [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/WtEzx43ZmD), which anyone is free to join, for asynchronous discussions before, during, and after the workshop.
